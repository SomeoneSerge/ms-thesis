\chapter{Conclusion}

In~\autoref{sec:statement} we have discussed naive convolutional layers for
hyperbolic representations and found these implementations to be insufficient
to achieve the desired performance. In~\autoref{sec:discussion} discussed why
these models may have failed and concluded that our experiments don't allow to
confidently discard the idea and that more ingenuous implementations are
needed.  There, we also described the principles on which to build refined
models.  In~\nameref{appendix:manifolds} we made an attempt to describe the
language and the general framework in which we would like to see geometric
methods to be treated.  In~\nameref{sec:geoopt} we discussed current challenges
for optimization on manifolds for deep learning.
