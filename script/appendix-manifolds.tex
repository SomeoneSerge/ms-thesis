Despite hyperbolic neural networks as promoted by Ganea and B\'ecigneul are
ultimately built in terms of Ungar's gyrovector formalism used by physicists,
and motivating arguments rather refer  to works in hyperbolic geometry, the
unifying language that does allow to connect the pieces and then formulate
computational algorithms is that of Differential Geometry. This appendix sets
out is to lay down, as carefully as possible, basics of Differential Geometry
in the form needed for consturcting optimization algorithms and models.  We'll
also discuss our Geoopt package and perspectives for improving it.  It shall be
noted: an attempt to realize this goal is futile a priori, especially that
author lacks competence in the subject. All we hope for is a reasonable
approximation.
