\chapter{Hyperbolic Neural Networks}

Every single work on ``hyperbolic deep learning'' starts with a definition of
Riemannian manifold and motivating words about curvature and hierachies. If one
looks closer, however, he\footnote{Remember, ``he'' is gender-less in this
manuscript} just might notice that definition of manifold is never used, that
curvature is never defined, and that novel layers are defined in terms of
``gyrovector additions'' and ``Einstein midpoints''. What is their position as
relative to the significant framework of differential geometry that we had to
build to just read the abstract? Goal of this appendix is to summarize
different related works specific to hyperbolic geometry in a way consistent
with the rest of framework.
