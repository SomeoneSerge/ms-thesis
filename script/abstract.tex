Gometric methods in deep learning try to exploit various geometric features in
the modeled phenomena, like curvature or symmetries. This thesis investigates
the idea of learning representations in curved spaces for data that does not
\emph{explicitly} exhibit features typically associated with curved metric
spaces (like hierarchical structures are associated with hyperbolic spaces).
Specifically, we develop two convolutional models for hyperbolic embeddings of
data, evaluated on image classification and pointcloud classification --
although the same method could potentially be useful for segmentation problems,
or detection and description tasks.  We then discuss the conceptual ``type
mismatch'' of these models, possible amendments, and connections to equivariant
neural networks. The major theme in the thesis is pointing out inconsistencies
in current methods. Thus we spend some space discussing in explicit
differential-geometric language the current state of Riemannian optimization
for DL (the mistakes we chose to make in Geoopt) and hyperbolic deep learning.
