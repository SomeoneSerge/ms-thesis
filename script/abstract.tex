This thesis deals with geometric methods in deep learning.  The main
contribution is to refine the theoretical grounds of hyperbolic neural
networks. On the experimental side, the thesis proposes two proof-of-concept
models that attempt to benefit from hyperbolic representations in problems of
point cloud and image classification, discusses the failure of these models,
and possible ways to fix these failures.  As this work does not (yet) achieve
the desired goal of constructing principled symmetry and curvature-aware neural
layers applicable in computer vision tasks, the author also considers this
thesis a map for the future research.
